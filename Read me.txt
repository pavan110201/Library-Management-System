In this Project, we created a database named "lms." Within this database schema, we created three tables: "Books," "Borrowers," and "Borrowing Transactions." 
We inserted 10 rows of data into the "Books" table, five rows of data into the "Borrowers" table, and five rows of data into the "Borrowing Transactions" table. 
Attached a SQL dump file to insert this data. 
 
We connected MySQL Workbench with Eclipse IDE using the JDBC connector. In Eclipse IDE, we created a project named "lms" and within the source code (src) directory, we created a pacakage called "lms". Within this package, we have a main class implemented under "ConnectDB.Java" with the following functionalities:
 
1. ADD BOOK
2. ADD BORROWER
3. BORROW BOOK
4. RETURN BOOK
5. SEARCH BOOK
6. VIEW BORROWING HISTORY

Running Application:
1. Run the attached SQL dump file on mySql workbench.
2. unZip the attached zip file and load java code with eclipse
3. update the jdbc connection with valid credentials on main class `ConnectDB.Java`
4. Run the Java Application.
